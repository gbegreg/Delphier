 This project is an example of an old-fashioned 2D platform game developed with Delphi (Sydney 10.4.2). It was produced for the article "Jeu de plateforme
 multi-plate-forme en Delphi" from Programmez! magazine number 247 (https://www.programmez.com/).
 
 Graphics are from Szadi (https://szadiart.itch.io/rocky-world-platformer-set). They are in asset directory like the file niveau1.json. This json file is the level  description.
  
 This game is cross-platform and you will find the binaries for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Android in the bin repository.
  
 It does not use any game engine ! So i can proudly indicate "Not made with Unity" :) 

 I am developing a game from Delphier but much more complete named <a href="https://www.gbesoft.fr/jeux.php#nagory">Nagory</a>. You will find the demo of Nagory on my <a href="https://www.gbesoft.fr/jeux.php#nagory">site</a> for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Android.
 The Android version is also available on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.gbesoft.NagoryDemo">Play Store</a>.
 
# How to play
 This is a demo, it's not a complete game. So the level is small.
 You just need to catch the 5 rupees to win the game. You can move to the right with the right arrow key, to the left with the left arrow key and jump with the space bar or the up arrow. Be careful not to hit enemies !
