# Delphier
  
 This project is an example of an old-fashioned 2D platform game developed with Delphi (Sydney 10.4.2). It was produced for the article Jeu de plateforme
 multi-plate-forme en Delphi" from Programez! magazine number 247 (https://www.programmez.com/).
 
 Graphics are from Szadi (https://szadiart.itch.io/rocky-world-platformer-set) 
  
 This game is cross-platform and you will find the binaries for Windows, Mac OS, Linux and Android in the bin repository.
  
 It does not use any game engine ! So i can proudly indicate "Not made with Unity" :)
